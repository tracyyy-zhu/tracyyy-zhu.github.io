<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I am Tracy Zhu. I'm currently a research assistant working with [Prof. Chen Wei](https://weichen582.github.io/) at [Rice University](https://csweb.rice.edu/), where I study spatially aware vision encoders in vision language action models. My research interests lie broadly in generative models, multimodal learning, and representation learning. 

I recently earned an M.S. in Statistics from [University of Chicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/), where I worked with  [Prof. Anand Bhattad](https://anandbhattad.github.io/) during his time at [TTIC](https://www.ttic.edu/). I received my B.A. in Data Science and Mathematics from [NYU](https://cas.nyu.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Tim G.J. Rudner](https://timrudner.com/) at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and [Prof. Marco Morucci](https://marcomorucci.com/bio/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) on uncertainty quantification for large language models. 

I am applying for a PhD in CS/ML starting in Fall 2026. Please feel free to reach out if our research interests align!
