Hello! I am Tracy Zhu, a second year MS student in Statistics at University of Chicago. My research interests include Generative models, Multimodal vision-language learning, and Self-supervised learning. 

I have been working with [Prof. Anand Bhattad](https://anandbhattad.github.io/) and [Prof. David Forsyth](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/) on image generation with diffusion models. I received my BA in Data Science and Mathematics from NYU, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Tim Rudner](https://timrudner.com/) and [Prof. Marco Morucci](https://marcomorucci.com/bio/) on uncertainty quantification at [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/). 

I am applying for a PhD in ML/CS starting in 2025. Please feel free to reach out if our research interests align!

<!-- I am Yilun Kuang, a second-year PhD student in Data Science at NYU CDS & NYU CILVR Lab advised by Andrew Gordon Wilson. My research interests includes Large Language Models, Diffusion Models, Self-Supervised Learning, Multimodal Vision-Language Learning, Probabilistic Generative Models, NeuroAI & AI for Science, Generalization Theory, and Numerical Methods.

Prior to starting PhD, I graduated magna cum laude with high honors from NYU with a BA in Mathematics. I was fortunate to work with SueYeon Chung and Eero Simoncelli on manifold geometry/efficient coding inspired self-supervised learning at the Center for Computational Neuroscience of Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation.

I am a PhD student at TTIC advised by Greg Shakhnarovich in the PALS Lab. I primarily work on 3D computer vision and generative modeling. Before coming to TTIC, I received my Master of Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, advised by Ayan Chakrabarti. I got my Bachelor of Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University. I have interned at Adobe Resarch, Meta Reality Labs and Megvii. -->
